I am an associate professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.  My research focuses primarily on theoretical cosmology.  I study how cosmological observations can be used to gain insights about fundamental physics.  I am particularly interested in the ways that we can utilize observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure to learn about the fundamental building blocks of the universe, the properties and interactions of dark matter and neutrinos, and the physics of the early universe.  See my [research page]({{site.base-url}}/research "Research") for more detail.
